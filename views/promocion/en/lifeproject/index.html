        <h3>Life project</h3>
        <p>
            It is said that the only constant in our lives is change, that everything changes 
            over time and that if there are no more changes in our lives we should start 
            to worry, so we must embrace change wherever it comes from, whether it’s the 
            end of an educational stage employment, social, etc,,,, or elsewhere within 
            ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe when one of those moments of making changes arrives, we want to jump 
            into the adventure to see what happens and improvise, and well that is ok, 
            but not everyone can just go and that’s it, There are those who have 
            responsibilities and need to plan a little, make what are called “life plans” 
            or in practice, make personal budgets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal budgets are lists of expenses that a person must consider in order to 
            maintain a desired standard of living; In these lists, everyone considers 
            different things, because we are not all the same and we give different 
            importance to things and even if we are in a hurry to start a new stage in our 
            life, there are those who could even sacrifice certain expenses.
        </p>
        <h3>the app</h3>
        <p>
            LifeProject is a free application developed for mobile devices (cell phones and 
            tablets) with Android Operating System, in which you can create and track your 
            life projects from a budgetary point of view, you can create lists of things you 
            think will spend your money and how much you are willing to invest in them. You 
            can even create and compare different cases of the same project to understand the 
            difference in expenses between them; In the end, you’ll know how much you need per 
            day, week or month and what salary or income you need to make your idea a reality
