        <h3>the app</h3>
        <p>
            Mandyficador is a free application developed for mobile devices (cell phones 
            and tablets) with Android operating system, in which you can create shopping 
            lists and track them (mark which products you have found). Also with this 
            application you can keep track of your pantry, this will allow you to create 
            smart lists (with the products that you don’t have in house).
        </p>
        <h3>shopping lists</h3>
        <p>
            When we go out looking for products, we can’t always find them in a single 
            store, or sometimes we know they’re cheaper elsewhere. Witch Mandyficador, 
            you can create as many lists as you want: list by product type, by business 
            type or by the business name itself, and work on them separately.
        </p>
        <h3>pantry lists</h3>
        <p>
            To know the status of your pantry, you can record which products and how much 
            of them you want at home. You can also record which ones you’re using, which 
            ones you’ve managed to stock up on during an outing, and request smart lists 
            with the missing products.
