        <h3>how to create a strong password</h3>
        <p>
            Creating a password is as simple as thinking of a word or phrase that will 
            protect the access to something important to us, such as a social media profile 
            or a bank account, and above all, trying not to forget it, well, nowadays it 
            can’t be just any word or phrase, it shouldn’t be things like 12345678 or abcdefgh 
            because they have been widely used, or things that are easy to guess, like personal 
            data or information about people close to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also depending on what we want to protect, we should take certain considerations, 
            such as defining the length of the password, protecting our conversations is not 
            the same as protecting important documents, that’s why there are different levels 
            of security in passwords. Today, password lengths of 8 to 11 characters are 
            considered weak, while 12 to 15 are considered good and 16 or more are considered 
            strong passwords, it is also good practice to change important passwords every 3 
            months and not use the same password for more than one service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another recommendation is not to use only letters from ‘a’ to ‘z’, but to add more 
            security you can add special characters (symbols !, @, #, etc..), numbers or blank 
            spaces and consider mixing uppercase letters with lowercase letters.
        </p>
        <h3>about the app</h3>
        <p>
            It seems that over time it has become a bit complicated to keep our accounts and 
            passwords secure, that’s why Segurificador was created, a free applicacion for 
            mobile devices (cell phones and tablets) with Android operating system, which 
            offers several methods to create passwords and make them secure so you don’t run 
            out of ideas, such as the random selection of characters with which you only have 
            to specify the length of your password or the reorganization or encryption of 
            phrases or texts and tools such as the exchange of letters for numbers or similar 
            symbols or randomly mixing uppercase letters with lowercase letters.
