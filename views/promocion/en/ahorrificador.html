        <p>did you know that to be considered a good saber you donâ€™t need to stop having 
            a social life or buy your favorite products, the only thing you need is to 
            learn to live with the 85 to 90% of your total incomes and save between the 
            10 and 15% of them, if you save more than this amount you would fall on 
            demotivation.</p>
