        <h1>Chooser</h1>
        <h2>decision-making app</h2>
        <h3>desicion-making</h3>
        <p>
            Even if we don’t realize it or it doesn’t seem like it, in out daily lives we 
            make hundreds of decisions, because eating one more bite or continuing walking 
            iS already a decision, either continuing to do the same things you’ve been up 
            to this point or taking a new direction in your life are also choices.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you can see, some of the decisions we face, and in fact most of them, are 
            simple things that we sometimes solve by following goals that we had already 
            pre-established in the past, such as being fitter or choosing the path of good, 
            things like get a soda or a bottled water at the store, although there are also 
            other decisions and perhaps one of them brings you here, more relevant decisions 
            with a greater impact on out lives, which make us think a little more, things like 
            choosing a career or our next address.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is why Chooser was created, a free application for mobile devices (cell phones 
            and tablets) with Android Operating System, with tools to accompany you in different 
            types of decision-making processes.
        </p>
        <h3>about the app</h3>
        <p>
            Chooser has a feature that lets you record your everyday situations-simple decisions 
            like choosing today’s dinner or what series to watch this afternoon and lists your 
            favorite options, so whenever you need a quick recommendation, you can consult the app 
            with the help of chance.
        </p>
        <p>
            For more important matters, the tool offer you a more comprehensive approach, guiding 
            you through a process that will help you to determine wich option is most relevant to 
            you, or what best suits you based on your current interests. This way, you’ll have a 
            clear idea of your preferences before consulting with your trusted people, or God.
