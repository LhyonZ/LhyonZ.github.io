        <h3>how to save money</h3>
        <p>
            Savings are an important part of our lives, as they provide us with a financial 
            cushion that allows us to respond in the event of an unforeseen event, such as 
            carrying out repairs or lack or work, also they give us a sense of security and 
            independence with which we can sometimes even opt for better opportunities by 
            helping us cope with times of transition more calmly.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two type of people in the world, the first, who are not characterized 
            by thinking much about the future, which is not bad either, as they prefer to live 
            in the moment, in special cases, they usually use other tools such as credits to 
            respond; for the second type of people, these actions could be a little stressful, 
            they save a portion of their income, sometimes what is left over after expenses and 
            other times an amount that they pre-established at some point in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
            How much of their income should a person save to have a healthy economy?, some 
            persons might feel like they don’t save enough, while other persons might save 
            more and miss out on opportunities or even get frustrated because they feel like 
            they work and don’t enjoy the fruits of their labor, someone once said that we 
            should learn to live on 70% of our salary and allocate the rest as follows: 10% 
            for spiritual causes (or pay debs), 10% to save and the rest to invest. In this 
            way, and this is the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            And what we can do with these savings? Well, we can count on them for unforeseen 
            events, or combine them with the portion intended for investments and think about 
            investment projects like buying tools or things that allow us to save either in 
            expenses or time such as buying a car or things that increase in value over time, 
            like land. If you still have some of your other 70% left, consider saving it up to 
            get a better cellphone, plan a trip, or whatever. 
        </p>
        <h3>about the app</h3>
